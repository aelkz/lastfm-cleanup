# Last.fm remove scrobbles from user library where play_count = 1
For now, this script creates a URL for removal of every existing artist in your last.fm with a low `play_count` for cleanup purposes.<br>
The `play_count` should be any number starting from `1`.

## 1 Installation (chrome configuration)

### 1-1 install tampermonkey on chrome
https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/tampermonkey/dhdgffkkebhmkfjojejmpbldmpobfkfo?hl=en

### 1-2 create a new tampermonkey user script w/ the following:
```shell
(function() {
    var aa = document.querySelectorAll("input[type=checkbox]");
    for (var i = 0; i < aa.length; i++){
        aa[i].checked = true;
    }
    setTimeout(() => {
        document.forms[3].submit(); // this is the form that contains de delete button
    }, "1000");
})();
```

PS. must change the `@match` tag URL to:

`@match        https://www.last.fm/user/<YOUR_LASTFM_USER>/library/music/**/+delete`

So, the idea here is when you click on any url in the above pattern, the browser will activate the tampermonkey script clicking the checkbox confirmation input and also smashing the submit button doing the artist removal automatically.

### 1-3 open `last.fm` website on chrome and log-in with your user account

There's no need to do anything else. You should have an existing user session on the browser.

## 2 Installation (python)

```shell
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## 3 Usage

### 3-1 Get a new dev API account on last.fm

https://www.last.fm/api/account/create

PS. You just need to enter your contact email and the application name fields.

### 3-2 Open the `config.py` file and set the values for `key`, `secret` and `username`

### 3-3 Run the script

```shell
# the script will prompt for your account password
python3 cleanup.py
```

The script will generate 2 urls for each occurrence found.
Click on the URL ending with `/+delete` to perform the auto-removal through the tampermonkey stuff.
voil√°!

## 4 Final Thoughts

Once you get all artists removed from your library, it is recommended to turn off the tampermonkey script on Chrome.
If you accidentally navigate to the following pattern, the script will be activated, and you can lose unwanted data.

## 5 Tips

You can customize the play count requirements. It is possible to increase it from `1` to `5` for example.
